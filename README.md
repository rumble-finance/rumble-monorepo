This repository contains the Rumble Finance Protocol core smart contracts, including the `Vault` and standard Pools, along with their tests, configuration, and deployment information.

## Structure

This is a Yarn 2 monorepo, with the packages meant to be published in the [`pkg`](./pkg) directory. Newly developed packages may not be published yet.

Active development occurs in this repository, which means some contracts in it might not be production-ready. Proceed with caution.

### Packages

- [`v2-deployments`](./pkg/deployments): addresses and ABIs of all Rumble Finance deployed contracts, for mainnet and various test networks.
- [`v2-vault`](./pkg/vault): the [`Vault`](./pkg/vault/contracts/Vault.sol) contract and all core interfaces, including [`IVault`](./pkg/vault/contracts/interfaces/IVault.sol) and the Pool interfaces: [`IBasePool`](./pkg/vault/contracts/interfaces/IBasePool.sol), [`IGeneralPool`](./pkg/vault/contracts/interfaces/IGeneralPool.sol) and [`IMinimalSwapInfoPool`](./pkg/vault/contracts/interfaces/IMinimalSwapInfoPool.sol).
- [`v2-pool-weighted`](./pkg/pool-weighted): the [`WeightedPool`](./pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/WeightedPool.sol) and [`WeightedPool2Tokens`](./pkg/pool-weighted/contracts/WeightedPool2Tokens.sol) contracts, along with their associated factories.
- [`v2-pool-utils`](./pkg/pool-utils): Solidity utilities used to develop Pool contracts.
- [`v2-solidity-utils`](./pkg/solidity-utils): miscellaneous Solidity helpers and utilities used in many different contracts.
- [`v2-standalone-utils`](./pkg/standalone-utils): miscellaneous standalone utility contracts.

## Build and Test

On the project root, run:

```bash
$ yarn # install all dependencies
$ yarn build # compile all contracts
$ yarn test # run all tests
```

This will run all tests in parallel. To run a single workspace's tests, run `yarn test` from within that workspace's directory.

You can see a sample report of a test run [here](./audits/test-report.md).

## Security

Multiple independent reviews and audits were performed by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) and [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/). The latest reports from these engagements are located in the [`audits`](./audits) directory.

All core smart contracts are immutable, and cannot be upgraded.

## Licensing

Most of the Solidity source code is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPL v3): see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).
